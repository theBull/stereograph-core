# StereographCore
Stereograph Core is an Angular 5 and Typescript library with a bulk of functionality and reusable components.

# Setup
`npm install`

# Development
For testing and development purposes, Stereograph Core lives inside of an Angular CLI -generated scaffold, which provides a test framework and application structure out of the box.

Everything you want to share to the world lives inside the `src/app/modules` directory. Everything outside of that is simply for use in development (live browser reload, unit tests, etc). The outside world will not see anything outside of `src/app/modules`.

## Unit tests
`ng test`

## Development server
`ng serve`
